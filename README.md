Map_Distances_Computer
======================

A program that calculates total distances for user defined segments. Uses the google map API and JavaScript.

This program allows the user to select various points an a region's map. It then calculates the total travel
travel distance as well as distances between the intermediate points. 
The user can delete or add points. All values wil be recalculated.
Distances are calculated in meters as a default but can be converted to other units (miles, yards, feet, meters)
with the click of a button.

The current version includes geodesic curves (sometimes helpful for measuring long distances) although I may
remove them in future versions based on feedback from friends.
